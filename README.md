# Interference
This code helps to visualize concept of interference. When interference is maximum and when it is minimum.
# Working principle
1. There is two sine waves of Same frequency. One is stady and other is shifting its phase(Moving).
2. After every small phase shift their interference is taken and Displayed.
3. Interference is computed using Principle of super position.
4. when they are in phase result is maximum. And when phase shift is 90 result is 0.
# Tools 
This code is mainly written in MATLAB (2017a) but also tested in GNU Octave 4.2.2
# Running the code
1. Clone or download Repository.
2. Open MATLAB or Octave.
3. Navigate inside the Repository.
4. Run Interference.m file
